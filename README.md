## How to run the website
1. Clone the repository or download the zip file
2. Inside the folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 
    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. 
    * If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 
    * For Python 3.x, you can use: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
    * If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
    * Note: For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
3. With your server running, visit: `http://localhost:8000` in the browser
